"""Engine-Adaptive Prompt Enhancer with Active LoRA Trigger Preservation.

Powered by a lightweight local LLM (mlx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-4bit)
running natively on Apple Silicon via MLX.

ENGINE_PROFILES here are a distilled compilation of official vendor prompt
guidance (verified against primary sources):
- FLUX.2 Klein : BFL Prompting Guide (docs.bfl.ai/guides/prompting_guide_flux2)
  — Subject+Action+Style+Context, word-order priority, no negatives, camera
  refs, object-bound HEX colors, quoted text, JSON-native, upsampling support
- SDXL Lightning: RunDiffusion/Juggernaut XL + Stability guidance
  (rundiffusion.com/juggernaut-xl-rundiffusion-guide) — dual-CLIP 77-token
  chunks, compact comma tags, background mandatory, decisive token weight
- Krea 2 Turbo  : Krea official prompting guidelines
  (github.com/krea-ai/krea-2/blob/main/docs/prompting.md) — natural language,
  long detailed prompts best, five structural layers, quoted in-image text
- Z-Image Turbo : Alibaba Tongyi-MAI model card + community best-practice
  guides (huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo) — long factual narrative,
  guidance 0 / no negatives, 6-part camera-first formula, bilingual text

Two output formats are supported:
- output_format="text" (default): engine-shaped narrative/tagged prose prompt.
- output_format="json": prompts filled per a structured JSON prompt schema
  ({"subject", "appearance", "action", "setting", "lighting", "atmosphere",
    "composition", "details", "text_elements", "technical", "trigger_word"}).
  Returns the JSON as `enhanced` plus a natural-language flattening for engines
  that prefer prose.

Guarantees 100% preservation and natural integration of active LoRA trigger words.
